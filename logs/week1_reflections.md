This log captures my notes, learnings, and reflections from **Week 1**.

## Day 1 – Setup & Repo Initialization

**Tasks Completed**
- [x] Installed Python 3.11+
- [x] Installed Cursor (primary IDE) and VS Code (for tutorials only)
- [x] Created and activated virtual environment
- [x] Installed required libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, yfinance, transformers, jupyter)
- [x] Created GitHub repo `ai-journey-2025`
- [x] Added folders: notebooks/, projects/, logs/, assets/
- [x] Added .gitignore, requirements.txt, and README.md
- [x] First commit & push to GitHub
- [x] Created test notebook `week1_basics.ipynb` and verified imports
- [x] Saved screenshot of setup in assets/

**What I Learned Today**
- How to set up a clean Python project environment using venv
- Organized a repo for long-term projects with a professional structure
- First experience running Jupyter inside Cursor

**Challenges / Blockers**
- None major — setup went smoothly

**Next Steps**
- Day 2: Start Python refresher with Automate the Boring Stuff (lists, dicts, loops, functions)
- Add first practice notebook (`week1_basics.ipynb`) with simple Python exercises
