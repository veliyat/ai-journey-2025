# 📌 AI Journey 2025 — Roadmaps

This folder contains different versions of my **AI Learning Roadmap** for 2025.  
The idea is to stay flexible: some days I may only have 1 hour, while other days I may have up to 4 hours.  
With these tiered plans, I can make steady progress no matter what.

## 🏆 Master Roadmap
- **[RoadMapUltimate](./RoadMapUltimate.md)** → The **main roadmap I’m following**.  
  - Tiered: 1h → 2h → 3h → 4h levels for each day.  
  - Based on *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* + project-based learning.  
  - Lets me adjust daily depth while staying on track.

## ⏱️ Time-Based Roadmaps
For reference, I’ve also created fixed daily schedules for different time commitments:

- **[RoadMap1h](./RoadMap1h.md)** → Gentle pace (~1h/day, ~24h/month).  
- **[RoadMap2h](./RoadMap2h.md)** → Balanced (~2h/day, ~48h/month).  
- **[RoadMap3h](./RoadMap3h.md)** → Deep (~3h/day, ~72h/month).  
- **[RoadMap4h](./RoadMap4h.md)** → Intensive & portfolio-ready (~4h/day, ~96h/month).

## 🎯 Why Multiple Roadmaps?
- To ensure **consistency** even on busy days (1h).  
- To allow **deeper exploration** when I have more time (2–4h).  
- To share this repo as a **resource**: others can pick the roadmap that matches their schedule.

## 🔑 Recommendation
- **Follow [RoadMapUltimate](./RoadMapUltimate.md)** if you want flexibility.  
- Use RoadMap1h–4h if you prefer a **fixed daily routine**.
