# 🌍 RoadMapUltimate — Flexible Tiered Plan (1h → 4h)

**Theme:** Adaptable learning pace (1–4h/day).  
**Goal:** Allow learners to scale their daily effort without losing continuity.  
**Approach:** Each day is structured into **tiers**. Start with **Tier 1 (Core)** and add more tiers if you have extra time.  

---

## 🧭 How to Use This Roadmap

- Each **day’s breakdown** lives in the [`/days/Week##/`](./days) folder.  
- Every day is split into **4 tiers**:  
  - **Tier 1 (1h) — Core:** Must-do tasks to keep progress steady.  
  - **Tier 2 (2h) — Extend:** Adds practice, refactoring, or new concepts.  
  - **Tier 3 (3h) — Advance:** Modularization, testing, optimization.  
  - **Tier 4 (4h) — Polish:** Documentation, CI/CD, professional presentation.  

👉 Start with **Tier 1**. If you have extra time:  
- Add **Tier 2** for practice & depth.  
- Add **Tier 3** for structure & testing.  
- Add **Tier 4** for polish & portfolio readiness.  

💡 Example:  
- You plan for 2h/day → follow **Tier 1 + Tier 2**.  
- Later you can spare 3h/day → just continue by adding **Tier 3** tasks on top, no need to redo earlier work.  
- Switching between tiers doesn’t break continuity — the roadmap is layered.

## ✅ Why This Roadmap?

- **Flexible:** No matter if you have 1h or 4h, you always make progress.  
- **Expandable:** Start small, then scale without losing context.  
- **Layered Learning:** Core → Practice → Structure → Polish.  
- **Practical:** Encourages building **projects that grow in complexity** over time.
