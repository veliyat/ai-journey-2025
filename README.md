# AI Journey 2025 🚀

Welcome to **AI Journey 2025** — my structured learning path into **Applied AI**, with a focus on **Finance** and **EdTech** projects.  
This repo serves as my **hub**, containing roadmaps, logs, and references to project repos.  

---

## 📌 Roadmaps  

To stay consistent while adapting to different schedules, I designed **multiple learning roadmaps**:  

- 🕐 **[RoadMap1h](./roadmaps/RoadMap1h.md)** → Gentle pace (~1h/day)  
- ⏱️ **[RoadMap2h](./roadmaps/RoadMap2h.md)** → Balanced (~2h/day)  
- ⏳ **[RoadMap3h](./roadmaps/RoadMap3h.md)** → Deep (~3h/day)  
- 🔥 **[RoadMap4h](./roadmaps/RoadMap4h.md)** → Intensive (~4h/day)  

👉 The main one I’m following is **[RoadMapUltimate](./roadmaps/RoadMapUltimate.md)** — a **tiered roadmap** where each day can expand from **1h → 4h** depending on my availability.  

📖 See the [📚 Roadmaps Overview](./roadmaps/README.md) for details.
